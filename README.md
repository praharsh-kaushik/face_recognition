# Face Recognition using Haar Cascade Classifier

### There are 3 steps to a Face Recognition System

1. Detect faces with the help of **Face Detection** code.

2. Add face data of different faces with the help of **Face Data Collection** code to _Face Dataset_ folder (upto 100th counter for better accuracy).

3. Finally run **Face Recognition** code and it will detect and tell the name of the persons whose face data is saved in the _Face Dataset_ folder. (the code in _Face Detection_ is also written in _Face Recognition_ code, so you don't have to run _Face Detection_ code seperately, it is only for understanding purposes)

P.s. - Save your face data in a bright lit environment, to have a better prediction.
